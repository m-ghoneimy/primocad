1. Text Tools

1.1. Text to TIN Surface
Command: TextToTinSurface
This command creates a TIN surface from text objects. The Z values of the created surface points match the numeric content values of the selected text objects.

Following are the steps to use this command:
From the ribbon, choose Z-Wizard tab ➪ Text Tools panel ➪ Text to TIN Surface (you can also type the command TextToTinSurface in the command bar).
At the Select objects prompt, select the text objects you want to use their contents as Z values.
(Note: Any objects other than the text objects will be automatically filtered out from the selection.)
At the Enter surface name prompt, type the name you want to assign to the created surface.

1.2. Text to COGO Point
Command: TextToCOGOPoint
This command creates COGO points at the locations of text objects. The Z values of the created points match the numeric content values of their corresponding text objects.
